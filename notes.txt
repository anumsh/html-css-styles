Calculating Specificity:
     The Higher the specificity weight of a selector, the most superiority the selector is given when a styling conflict occurs.
     ID selector: hold the oint value of 1-0-0.
     Class selector: hold the value of 0-1-0.
     Type selector: hold the value of 0-0-1.
     
     For example: if the paragraph element is slected usinh type slector in one place and an ID selector in another place, the ID selector will take the precedence over type selector.
     
     
     The Cascade:
     
     p
     {
     background:orange;
     font-size:24px;
     }
     
     p {
     background: green;
     }
     
     in above example:  paragraph selector that sets the background color to green comes after the paragraph selector that sets the background color to orange, it will take precedence. 
     
     green background will appear.
     
     
     combining selector:
